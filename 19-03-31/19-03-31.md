## Question 1.

### Validate if a given string is numeric.

    Some examples:
    "0"=>true
    " 0.1 "=>true
    "abc"=>false
    "1 a"=>false
    "2e10"=>true

Note: It is intended for the problem statement to be ambiguous. You should gather all requirements up front before implementing one.

## Question 2.

### You are given a string, S, and a list of words, L, that are all of the same length. Find all starting indices of substring(s) in S that is a concatenation of each word in L exactly once and without any intervening characters.

    For example, given:
    S:"barfoothefoobarman"
    L:["foo", "bar"]

    You should return the indices:[0,9].
    (order does not matter).
